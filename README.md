# System-Design-
#Day1Session 
☺☺Hello all my Linkedln family here I am just deep diving into hashtag#SystemDesign✔In this post I'll just talk about how the system design is important  terms and concepts that I have learnt in this session.
✔System Design is very important to build a scaleable system and applications.
✔It will helps me to build a scaleable system and Engineering mindset.
✔I think this is the main underline principle to learn  system design.

What is system design? 
✔In the world of software high level planning followed by low level planning/detailed planning followed by the final execution the is called a system design.
✔After a solid understanding of system design we will move towards the life cycle of a system design. 
In the life cycle of a system deaign there are  some steps to be follow.
✔1 Requirements 
Again Requirements divided into two parts 
⏺Functional requirements
⏺Non functional requirements 

✔2 Prioritization/Phase 

✔3 Infrastructure estimations 
Again infrastructure estimations divided into three parts.
⏺Storage 
⏺Computation 
⏺Network 

⏺4 Components 

⏺5 Communication 
And that is called HLD (High Level Design)
✔System Design divided into two parts 
⏺1 High Level Design 
⏺2 Low Level Design 

✔After mastering and solid understanding of these topics we will move towards. 
✔The back of the envelope calculations.
⏺Units of time 
⏺Comman execution time 

✔After the understanding of these stuffs.
We explored more concepts 
⏺Cache 
⏺Caching mechanism 
⏺Reading data from main memory, disk and network 
⏺Availability 
⏺Query Per Seconds (QPS)
⏺System architect 

And I am very thankful to my most favourite mentor ❤❤❤❤ hashtag#vishwamohan sir 

#Day2session 
😊😊Hello all my linkedln family here I am thrilled to announce that just I deep dive into hashtag#systemdesign 
✔Today is my day 2 session I engrossed in this session and get more confidence in system design.
✔It helps me to think about approaches to build a scaleable system and applications.
✔I have spent 2 to 3 hours to get this valueable knowledge in hashtag#SystemDesign 
✔In this session I have learnt these terms and concepts.
⏺Distributed system 
⏺Vertical scaling 
⏺Challenges of vertical scaling 
⏺Horizontal scaling 
⏺Challenges of horizontal scaling 
⏺Replication
⏺Consistency 
⏺Inconsistency 
⏺Eventually consistency 
⏺Availability 
⏺Reliability 
✔After mastering these kinds of stuffs I took 5 minutes break 
After break I keep it up and stay motivated to mastering these topics that is .......

⏺CAP THEOREM 
C = Consistency 
A = Availability 
P = Partition tolerance 
⏺Actual inference of CAP THEOREM 
⏺Intuitive explanation of CAP THEOREM
✔After mastering these kinds of stuffs 
We talked about some interview questions and approaches behind these questions 
✔This session was very fruitful for me and I am very thankful to my most favourite mentor ❤❤hashtag#vishwamohan sir 

#Day3Session 

☺☺ Hello all my linkedln family I am thrilled to announce that I started deep dive into system design.
✔Today is my 3rd session to engrossed in the system design.
✔This session helps me to understand the architecture of a scaleable application and which architecture is suitable while developing a scaleable application.
✔This session is very fruitful for me and I am very thankful to my most favourite mentor mentor VISHWA MOHAN sir ❤❤
✔System Design is very important for our interview perspective and system design helps to become a better software engineer.
✔I have spent almost 3 to 4 hours to grab these concepts. 
⏺Architecture 

⏺Monolithic architecture 

⏺Advantages of a Monolithic system 

⏺Challenges of a Monolithic architecture 



✔After mastering these kinds of stuffs in monolithic system I moved towards next concept that is SOA (SERVICE ORIENTATED ARCHITECTURE )



⏺What is SOA ( SERVICE ORIENTATED ARCHITECTURE )

⏺When we have to use SOA 

⏺Advantages of SOA 

⏺Challenges of SOA 



✔After mastering service orientated architecture (SOA ) I moved towards a new concept that is the world is gaga of this architecture in this modern world that is Microservices architecture.



⏺Microservices 

⏺Advantages of Microservices 



✔After mastering these kinds of stuffs I took 10 minutes break and after that I have mastered these concepts that are ....

⏺Client and Server 

⏺Latency 

⏺Throughput

⏺Why we have to analyse throughput

⏺How can I improve the throughput



✔After that I mastered these kinds of stuffs that is


⏺Load Balancer 

⏺Types of the Load Balancer 

1) Hardware load balancer 

2) software load balancer 

⏺OCI Layers 

1) Transport layer /load balancer 

2) layer 7 application layer load balancer 

⏺Algorithms of Load Balancer 

1) Round Robin 

2) Least Connection 

3) Least respons time 

4)weighted round robin 

5) Sticky load balancing 


#Day4Session

☺☺ Hello all my linkedln family I am thrilled to announce that I started deep dive into system design and day by day going ahead in system design.
✔Today is my 4th session to engrossed in the system design.
✔This session helps me to understand the whole concepts of file based storage system, database management system, Relational databases management system, all the concepts of NOSQL database and also database optimization with the help of indexing, partitioning/sharding,Caching.
✔This session is very fruitful for me and I am very thankful to my most favourite mentor mentor VISHWA MOHAN sir ❤❤
✔System Design is very important for our interview perspective and system design helps to become a better software engineer.
✔I have spent almost 2 to 3 hours to grab these concepts. 

Keep learning

#Day5session hashtag#SystemDesign 
😊😊Hello connections I am thrilled to announce that I started deep dive into hashtag#SystemDesign and day by day going on with a consistent manner.

⏩Today I have done another session this session helps me to better understanding of types of NOSQL and when we have to use different types of nosql databases and database optimization.
⏩In this session I have spent 2 to 4 hours to achieve this valuable knowledge and all the doubts are sorted regarding database optimization beat indexing, partitioning, sharding.
⏩Here all the topics and concepts that I have covered in this session ..........................................................................................................................
✳In NOSQL ( BASE ) Properties 
✳In RDBMS ( ACID ) Properties 
✳Key Value database ( RADIS ) 
✳Document database ( MONGODB )
✳Columnar database ( CASANDRA )
✳Graph database ( NEO4J )
✳Use case of all the databases and also advantages and disadvantages

⏩After that moving toward database optimization
In database optimization and I have covered all these concepts and these concepts helps me to better understanding of database optimization.
▶️Indexing 
▶️Partitioning 
▶️Again partitioning are also three types 
▶️1) Range bases partitioning 
▶️2) List based partitioning 
▶️3) Hash based partitioning 
▶️ Sharding 
▶️ Distributed file system for storing videos in databases 
▶️And all the use cases of all types of partitioning, advantages and disadvantages 
⏩And also exploring some real world applications under line principle and behind the scenes of their tech stacks.

↪In this session I got  💯💯💯 better understanding and Engineering mindset  behind a modern scaleable application. 

♾And I am very thankful to my most favourite mentor VISHWA MOHAN ❤❤❤❤sir.
Hustle with Ravi 
Keep Coding 
Be Happy 
Stay Motivated 

#day6session hashtag#SystemDesign 
...😊😊😊Hello all my linkedln family I am thrilled to announce that I have done another session in system design.
▶️ Day by day I am deep diving into hashtag#SystemDesign
▶️ This consistent hard work helps me to understand the system design of any scalable application.
▶️ Today I have done these concepts to better understanding of  processing and Communications in system design.............................................................................................................................
↪ Types of processing/Communications 
➡️ 1) Synchronous 
➡️ 2) Challanges of Synchronous processing 
➡️ 3) Cascading failures 
➡️ 4) Asynchronous 
▶️We can use multiple approaches in Asynchronous processing like......
➡️ 1) Call back approach
➡️ 2) Messaging system approach 
▶️ In messaging system there are one system is very famous that is publisher and subscriber in short pub sub approach. 
➡️ 3) about Kafka 
▶️ Kafka is very famous for it's distributed/Robust messaging system. 
It is relevant for peer to peer p2p messaging.
▶️ Broadcasting 
▶️ Pipelining in big data processing
 
⏩ After a better understanding of these stuffs and concepts we discussed about the real world's applications messaging system and underline principle of a real time application like IRCTC, BOOKMYSHOW.
✔I am very thankful to my most favourite mentor hashtag#VISHWAMOHAN ❤❤ SIR
This session will get me 💯💯 a better understanding of system design
